# Motivation

My objective is to investigate behavior of random graphs with an underlying latent community structure. I will explore a random graph assumed to be produced from a generative model over some unknown probability distribution, and will analyze the performance of community detection and partial recovery techniques on the average case. I will then apply these methods to real-life data: a graphical representation of related artists through digital music service Spotify's Web API.
